This folder is a place to attempt to keep notes as an alternative to using an app like Standard Notes or Simplenote.

A subset of these notes that are public will be synced to `zachlatta/public-notes` on GitHub.

I think the purpose of using something that uses a Markdown file backend is that it will be more flexible down the line. But one of the challenges is iOS / mobile support.

Hopefully I'll be able to figure out something with Synology. Might make sense to set up some kind of backup system with git.

Ideas:

- Dump Markdown files from all previous note taking systems to subfolders in this folder
- Set up a sync script with git that runs on Synology periodically to push things to a git repo
- Consider using https://johnnydecimal.com/ to organize files
