I started the book yesterday. I already feel overwhelmed by the concept of tensors. For some reason the concept of "ranks" in tensors is not clicking with me. What is the difference between a rank-2 tensor and a 2 dimensional array? Is there any difference at all?  Why am I so stupid.

We are in chapter 2 and implementing the `relu` function. What does this mean. I don't understand it. What does it actually do. How does it actually transform the data we give it?

For the MNIST data we are working with, I don't understand how the images are turned into tensors (is that the right word?).
