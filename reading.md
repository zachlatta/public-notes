2022

* December
	* Mistborn - amazing. So good. Amazing world. First Brandon Sanderson book. Amazing more advanced YA style book. I don't understand why the king got to become king. Caleb thank you for recommendation. 5 stars.
	 * Mistborn Book 2 - Not as good as the first, but I like how it expanded the world and took the series in an unexpected direction.

2023

- January
	- Mistborn Book 3 - Way closer to the first in terms of feel. I loved how epic and big the first was. Complex world, simple characters. Book 2 and Book 3 were both very interesting - it took the series in a direction I didn't expect at all. Super excited to read more Brandon Sanderson books.
