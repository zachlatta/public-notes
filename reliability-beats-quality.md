One of the humbling things that has taken me years to learn.

Let's say someone makes something high quality. And let's say someone will give them $100 for it.

Now let's say that person can make that high quality thing once a week. I always assumed that'd be worth $150.  It's actually more like $500. The premium for reliability is often many multiples.

- Let's say you are a graphic designer and you are hired to design a logo for a client. You may not be the most creative or talented designer, but if you can consistently deliver the logo on time and within the agreed upon specifications, your clients will likely be happy with your work. They may even be willing to pay you a higher price for your services because they know they can depend on you to get the job done. In this case, the reliability of your work is more valuable to the client than the individual level of quality of the logo.
