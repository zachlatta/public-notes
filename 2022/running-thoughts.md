Have a mission
Plan ahead
Question everything
Assume nothing
Roll up your sleeves
Study the past
Take risks
Dream higher
Welcome change
Have an amazing haircut
Laugh
Be curious
Pay attention to details
Make mistakes
Think sideways
Do things with passion 
Don't forget to play
Take it to the edge
Breathe.

Creativity takes courage.
