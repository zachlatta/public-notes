The balance of creating enough structure, while preserving individual freedoms, and giving all as much opportunity to self-determination as possible.

Success of society starts with prosperity. Country standing in world largely directly correlates with economic prowness.

Moral hazard when too much self-determination bad sides without consequences, ex public drug usage. The full cost is not realized, like use of fossil fuels or meat. Moral hazard applies to both individual and to society for letting the circumstance happen, both don't internalize appropriate consequences.
